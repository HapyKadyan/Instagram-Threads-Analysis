## Why users are giving 1 rating   
1. Mark Zuckerburg wasted a lot of money in copy paste work(*clone of Twitter*).
2. *Constant crashing* when trying to upload post. We love Twitter.
3. *UI overlays* on top of each other which makes reading anything is Impossible.
4. constantly says *'Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again'*. This is frustrating.
5. The data collection on this app is *SINISTER* can use it commercially.
6. *Very dangerous* for user security (Absolute disaster ðŸ˜‘).
7. The application needs a lot of development. Looks like it's a *launch without trial*.
8. Downloaded and deleted within 5 minutes. Itâ€™s a political echo chamber for people who *people who left Twitter*.
9. *Junk news* on every site, showing 99% post from accounts that I didn't follow.
10. can't register without having instagram account and can't delete without deleting entire instagram.*It's a trap!*



## Why users are giving 5 rating 
1. Great...*no subscription or limitations* problem.
2. I love threading. Its so refreshing.
3. If you can't find your favorite creator they will be in a *pending box* and once they downloaded it, it will automatically make you followed.
4. Great app and a *great competitor*, Far better than Twitter(Evidently a rushed app to fill the gap left by twitter).
5. This is very similar to the bird app, but *without the rampant toxicity*.
6. *no ads* yet, which is why I gets 5 stars.
7. Great app with lots of potential. The app's social features are also fantastic. I can connect with friends who are also using Thread's, create groups, and even send direct invites to plan lunch dates. It's a great way to stay connected and coordinate lunch outings with ease.
8. "Love the app ... One thing I would like is the volume on the videos being easier to select as on .. and once it's on for one, stays on for all until I turn it off.
9. The user interface is super easy to learn and get used to. Plus, the features are superb.
10. Mostly belives in meta, they think 'Not bad! This is its first launch. There is still room for improvements...Upgraded to 5 star cause meta team heard my complaint as soon as I reported it.

## What types of updates user are asking
I wanna to see a 
- trending page
- longer videos
- an edit button for any threads(posts) uploaded by the user(Edit Feature).
- Add a pause button(and slow motion controls for videos).
- Following list
- Hashtags, means if we wanna trend something we gotta use that.
- Functional Search button
- to save picture like Twitter
- Needs iPad or tablet or web desktop support
- no more crashing problem
- translation option
- option to delete threads without deleting instagram.
- Etc.....................


## One question, which one will win Blue Bird or threads in future?
I can't believe Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are fighting for a app like this
